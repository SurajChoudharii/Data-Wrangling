## 📊 Data Wrangling Project

This project demonstrates essential data wrangling techniques using Python and pandas, applied to an employee dataset. It focuses on cleaning, transforming, and understanding the structure of the data to prepare it for analysis or modeling.

### 🔍 Project Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:

* `Employee_ID`
* `Name`
* `Age`
* `Department`
* `Salary($)`
* `Joining_Date`
* `Performance_Score`
* `Promotions`
* `Remarks`

### 🛠️ Tasks Performed

* Loaded data from a CSV file using `pandas`
* Renamed or defined column headers
* Explored the dataset using `.shape`, `.head()`, and `.info()`
* Handled missing values and data inconsistencies
* Converted data types (e.g., string to datetime)
* Standardized salary and date formats

### 🧰 Libraries Used

* `pandas`
* `numpy`

### 📁 File Structure

* `Data_Wrangling.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing all data preprocessing steps
* `assignment.csv` – Input dataset file (expected in the same directory)
